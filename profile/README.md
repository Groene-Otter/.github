## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

At Groene Otter we focus on developing tooling that helps companies and organisations with their sustainability. Currently we are designing software that helps with the double materiality analysis of the CSRD and also software that helps small and medium enterprises to report on their sustainability issues.

### First platform for VSME
With the VSME released publically on the 17th of December we can now confidentally continue our work. We've already been working on the designs of the tooling and can continue with the next phase. On our [our website](https://groeneotter.nl/en/platform) you can find more information about our software.
